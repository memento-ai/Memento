# This is a test configuration file with all fields filled in.
# Because all fields are filled in, any memento.toml files in directories above this one

# Many of the fields here are set to distinct and unrealisitc values so that we can test that the
# correct values are being loaded, either directly, or via loadAggregateConfig()
